                India-based artist Mamta Singh is a professional wall artist, doodler and an illustrator.
    Originally a law graduate, Mamta found her calling in art when she painted a wall in her house.
     When she completed the wall, she knew she wants to do this for the rest of her life.
    In 2012, she started by selling handmade products like mugs and diaries. 
    She widened her horizons into wall murals, illustrations and art installations. 
    In 2016, she took up art full-time. By 2018, she was one of the most loved artists in the country.
    After creating a niche for herself in India, Mamta kicked off her global journey in 2019.
    On her way to become Asia’s most loved art tutor, Mamta conducted over 300 workshops for 4000+ 
    students across India, Nepal, Philippines and Indonesia. Much like Mamta herself, her workshops are 
    like a breath of fresh air. Her unique style  is to teach art through fun. She believes there is 
     in each one of us. She emphasizes on finding your personal style and voice in art. She believes consistency,
     practice and originality takes each one a very long way. 
    She switches her time between transforming walls of clients and transforming minds of aspirants at her workshops. She loves to travel, ride bikes, play drums and learn something new each day
